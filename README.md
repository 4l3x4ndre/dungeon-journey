# Dungeon Journey

This is a simple javascript prototype for a 2d dungeon game. The code is definitely not clean. It's a bit messy, but the goal wasn't to make it public. 

To try optimize canvas drawing, I use two of them. The first one draw the map each new level, while the other one draw the player and enemies each frame.

No libraries used.
